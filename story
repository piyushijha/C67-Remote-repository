I The three blind mice were trying to steal wood. The farmer's wife cut off their tails with a chopping knife and the blind mice were left hungry. 
A cat that was nearby was hungry too but didn't go near since she liked her furry tail very much. The three blind mice decided that stealing food was not something they could do. 
They decided to put on a circus where people gave money to see them stumble aroung, doing normal chores. After a month, they were the richest blind mice in the world. 
The End.
